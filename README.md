✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Merging Objects

1. Select Objects

First, select all the GameObjects you want to merge in the scene.

✅ Tip: It’s better if the objects are not parented to each other.

If they are parented (child/parent), the merge won’t result in a single mesh.

Instead, you’ll get a parent with merged children — not one unified mesh.




---

2. ProBuilderize the Objects

Go to the top menu:

Tools > ProBuilder > Object > ProBuilderize

A confirmation dialog will appear:

> “Do you want to make these objects editable with ProBuilder?”



Click OK to continue.


⚠️ Bug Warning:
Sometimes after ProBuilderizing, Unity deselects your objects automatically.

> 👉 If that happens, just select them again before proceeding.

3. Merge the Objects

With the same objects still selected, go to:

Tools > ProBuilder > Object > Merge Objects

The selected objects will now be merged.
✅ If they are not nested (child/parent), they will become a single unified mesh.

⚠️ Known Bug in ProBuilder 6.0.5

If you perform multiple merges in the same scene, you may notice:

Previous merged objects get separated again

The new merge may fail or revert



---

✅ BK’s Pro Tip (Bug Workaround)

To avoid merge bugs:

1. Create a new empty scene


2. Move only the objects you want to merge into this new scene


3. Perform ProBuilderize + Merge in this clean scene


4. Then import the merged object back into your main scene



> 🔥 This method gives you a clean, unified mesh without interference

🧠 Summary Table:

Step	Action

1	Select objects (avoid parent-child if you want one mesh)
2	ProBuilderize (confirm and reselect if needed)
3	Merge Objects
Bug	Merges may break if done multiple times in one scene
Fix	Use a clean scene for merging, then import back
